# JAVA-SA-and-GA-implementation
A faculty project where the main goal was to solve the bin-packing problem using the simulated annealing and genetic algorithms

On the Container_allocation_interface folder you may find an implementation using JSwing for ruling the parameters used in each algorithm.

A description of the problem can be found below:

You are given a set of N objects, and for each one of these objects I the weight W(I) is known. You have an unlimited supply of containers, each of capacity Cj. The goal is to put each object into a container in such a way that we do not exceed the capacity of any
container, while using the smallest number of possible containers.

The only information that you have consists in a set of files, containing the capacity of each container, and the weights of 14
different objects. 
More in particular, the following files: p02_c.txt, which contains the capacity of the containers; 
p02_w.txt, which contains the weights of the objects.

With the data contained in these files, the globally optimal solution is the one included
in the file p02_s.txt.
